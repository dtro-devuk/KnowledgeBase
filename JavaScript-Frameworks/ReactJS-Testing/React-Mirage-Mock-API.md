# Mirage JS - API Mocking

## Intro

***Build complete frontend features,
even if your API doesn't exist.***

"Mirage JS is an API mocking library that lets you build, test and share a complete working JavaScript application without having to rely on any backend services."


## How?

"Mirage uses an in-memory database to maintain the referential integrity of your application data. This lets you build out fully dynamic features, even ones that depend on data-fetching and persistence logic, without ever leaving your frontend codebase."
