## Intro

> The React framework for Production (MIT License)

- Opensource
- Released Oct 2016

Nextjs (by Vercel) is a React based framework, that renders react applications on the server.
Its blazing fast and SEO friendly, due to offering Statitic Site Generation (SSG) as well as Server Side Rendering (SSR).

### Static and Dynamic for JAMstack

Normal React apps, use JavaScript, which requires it to be enabled in your browser. Nextjs fixes this through
SSG and SSR, whereby the app is either 'built' as an SSG (no JS) at build time, or are pre-rendered using SSR.
This makes it very fast on the server, with an overall better user experience.
This combined with great SEO features, make it a perfect choice for SPA's, apps, Blogs etc.
