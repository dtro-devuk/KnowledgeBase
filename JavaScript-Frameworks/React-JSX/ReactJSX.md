## JSX Essentials, Summary courtesy of the links below...

Its a syntax extension to JavaScript. It produces React Elements.

JSX provides syntatic sugar for the React.createElement(component, props, ...children) function.

Its used with React to describe what the UX should look like.
Its a bit like a template lang, but with the full power of JavaScript.

This means it compiles to react. In order for this to happen, it needs to be compiled in your solution, unless
you are using the online references to the library.
