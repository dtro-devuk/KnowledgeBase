*Azure Service Fabric Knowledge base* | dtro-devuk | 1.0 | Root | **0**

Azure Service Fabric is a Platform-as-a-Service offering, which promises us a way to build highly reliable, massively scalable cloud based services

* Service Fabric comes in different flavours catering to different requirements. 
* There are two APIs available to us, 
1. Reliable Actors and 
2. Reliable Service(s) API's, 
* and the services we build can be either **stateful** or **stateless**.

### Overview

Advantages of Service Fabric and Microservices

* **Create independently deployable microservices:** easier to deploy than n-tier architectures
* **Autonomous experimental teams:** allows creation of nimble, teams that can deliver functionality quicker.
* **Leverage a cloud platform:** minimize writing plumbing code, and maximize feature development, allowing the teams to ship more customer features.


Taken from benefits to TalkTalk TV...

* **Agility:** Rolling upgrades, granular versioning, packaging and deployment to achieve faster delivery cycles and maintain uptime during upgrades.
* **Development environment and programming models:** Developers able to build and run the solutions locally using the Service Fabric SDK using a combination of the reliable actors and reliable services programming models.
* **Scalability:** The granularity of service scaling and versioning enables the system to scale as the number of users, devices, and content grows.
