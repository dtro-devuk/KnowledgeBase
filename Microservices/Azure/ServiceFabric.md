Azure Service Fabric is a Platform-as-a-Service offering, which promises us a way to build highly reliable, massively scalable cloud based services

* Service Fabric comes in different flavours catering to different requirements. 
* There are two APIs available to us, 
1. Reliable Actors and 
2. Reliable Service(s) API's, 
* and the services we build can be either **stateful** or **stateless**.
