### Intro

* [Introduction to ASP.NET CORE SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/introduction)
* [Use Hubs in SignalR for ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/hubs?view=aspnetcore-3.1)

### Authentication

* [Authentication and Authorization in .NET CORE SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/authn-and-authz)

### With Webpack and Typescript

* Scaffold a starter ASP.NET Core SignalR app
* Configure the SignalR TypeScript client
* Configure a build pipeline using Webpack
* Configure the SignalR server
* Enable communication between client and server

Webpack enables developers to bundle and build the client-side resources of a web app. 

*[This tutorial demonstrates using Webpack in an ASP.NET Core SignalR web app whose client is written in TypeScript. 10/02/2020](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/signalr-typescript-webpack?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio)

### Streaming

ASP.NET Core SignalR supports streaming from client to server and from server to client. 
This is useful for scenarios where fragments of data arrive over time. 
When streaming, each fragment is sent to the client or server as soon as it becomes available, rather than waiting for all of the data to become available.
