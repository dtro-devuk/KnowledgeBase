## Intro

> Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML

A atomic utility-first CSS framework. Its just awesome :smile:

Fedup of cumbersome, complex, wieldy, opnionated CSS frameworks, I recently swapped to Tailwind CSS and never look back.

Allowing you to create awseome CSS, quickly with awesome looking end results.

## React Features

|                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Atomic CSS**                  | Nextjs server detects file modification and does auto reload.                               |
| **Automatic Routing**           | Url's are mapped to the file folder system: (`pages`) folder. Optional use React Router.    |
| **SinglFile Components**        | styled-jsx builit-in and provides support for global as well as component specific styles.  |
| **Automatic Code splting**      | efficient rendering of only `used` libs, code, css, etc, split at the component/page level. |
| **Prefetch**                    | the nextjs `Link` component has a `prefetch` property built in to prefetch page resources.  |
| **Server side Renring**         | react components are pre-rendered on server hence faster loading on clients.                |
| **Static Site exports**         | Full static site export to an `out` folder.                                                 |
| **Dynamic components**          | Next.js allows the import of JavaScript modules and React Components dynamically.           |
| **Node Ecosystem**              |
| **Built-in TypeScript support** | Excellent built-in TypeScript support.                                                      |
